Repo of code from Northwestern University's EECS-213, Introduction to Computer Systems

The main project was implementing our own version a dynamic storage allocator, writing malloc, free, realloc, and several other functions.

The mm.c file is the code which I worte, along with Tyler Rodgers. All other code was provided by the course faculty.
